Stupid bot for playing pranks. I made this because a friend wanted it.
Feel free to fork it, steal it, use it for whatever.

Features
--------

* **Social distancing:** Responds to each message that isn't its own with a blank
  message to aid social distancing in these difficult times. Has a roughly 20%
  chance to not send a message, to mirror the jankiness of the Internet during
  this pandemic.

Usage
-----

1. Download a copy of `config.yml.example` and the JAR from the Releases tab above
2. Copy the JAR into a folder, along with `config.yml.example`
3. Rename `config.yml.example` to `config.yml` and fill it out
4. Run the JAR - double-click or `java -jar Dumbo-*-all.jar`
